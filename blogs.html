                <h4>How to step out from grieving.</h4>
                <!--                <p> <strong>Have you ever feel like you can't get rid of the bad memory?<strong>-->
                <br>It is undeniable that grieving is one of the major issue that effects our daily life, either in short term or long term.
                Sometimes it's hard to avoid it. But guess what?
                <br><strong style="font-size: 1.3rem">YOU</strong> <strong>can choose not to let it be with you forever, so what can we do then?</strong>
                <br>
                <br> One thing we can do is do not struck too long in the grieving period. Feeling sad for a while is totally natural following
                an upsetting event, when you have those feeling try to pull yourself out of that period and start living again.
                The key is your mind and your brain. Do you know it work together?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> To do that, start with relaxing your mind, try to forget that bad feeling, telling yourself that you are going to be happy,
                and you are going to stop grieving. That way is the way to trick your brain and when you keep thinking that positive thought over and over again, your brain becomes in
                the way you want. It starts releasing bad feeling and replace with good feeling instead.
                <br>
                <br>Well, one of you might find it hard following those step, how about trying this tip. The idea is not to just forget, recovering and healing are also important.
                Sometimes telling someone, such as a trusted friend or a therapist, can help you to reduce those bad feeling.
                Keeping things bottled up inside will only make the pain continue to grow. If you feel like life is not worth living,
                then reach out to someone, and by all means please consider therapy. There are people who can help you.
